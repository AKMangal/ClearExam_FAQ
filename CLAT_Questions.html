                            After clearing CLAT you got the admission in NLUs.
                            Since there are a lot of NLUs and you haven't mentioned any specific NLU i.e, fees of one
                            NLU is 7.5 lakh and all other NLUs are minimum 7.5 lakh.

                            There's no need to take math in class 11 but for the preparation of CLAT exam you have to

                            Every exam has the same criteria to decide the rank of two students who got the same score,
                            for that you have to check any exams' official websites.

                            Since there is no connection of the board marks with the CLAT marks but for the longer run
                            10th marks is the most important thing. So don't take it lightly.
                            The results of CLAT NLU and merits are decided on the basis of CLAT scores only.

                            Hello<br>
                            The CLAT Consortium has postponed the CLAT 2021 exam, which was set to take place on June
                            13th. Due to an increase in COVID-19 cases around the country, the law entrance exam has
                            been postponed indefinitely, posing a threat to all parties in the exam. The new CLAT exam
                            date for 2021 will be revealed later. Meanwhile, the Consortium has extended the deadline
                            for CLAT 2021 applications until June 15th.
