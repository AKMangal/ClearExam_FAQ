                            For becoming a judge after completing LLB you should have to apply for the Judicial Service
                            Examination. Then after clearing this exam you can become a judge in the Subordinate courts.
                            But for becoming a High court or Supreme court Judge is not so easy because you have to gain
                            a lot of knowledge and experience on it then only you can apply for it.
